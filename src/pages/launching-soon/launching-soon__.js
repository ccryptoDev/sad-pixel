                    Sad Pixels is the first stage of a 3-phase multimedia art project. 
                    Each phase represents a multi-layered approach to one overarching theme: <span className="italic">Technology and social media are destroying our mental health.
                  </span></p>
                  <p>
                    There is room for generative art collections to explore themes of deeper substance, make social commentary, and expand into the world of subversive art. 
                    This project aims to do just that.
                  </p>
                  <div className="m-5">
                    <img src={banner} alt="sad pixel" />
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    The phases of the project reflect the evolution of minimalistic pixel art into a fully immersive experience:

                  <div className="abstract">
                    <p>Phase 1: Pixel Art</p>

                    <p>Phase 3: Metaverse Expansion & Tokenomics</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    This progression incrementally unlocks value for the community as the phases evolve into higher art forms. 
                    As our community grows and we gather feedback, some elements of the project may change. At each phase, donations will be made to mental health organizations, chosen with the help of the community. 
                    Sad Pixels is being launched by a California team of entertainment industry veterans. More details on the project and the team below.

                  <p>
                    Sad Pixels will be released as a 10,000 character NFT collection. Every character is unique and randomly assigned on-chain (with the exception of 10 ultra rare GIFs, explained below). 
                    This on-chain randomization method ensures that community members get a fair chance at minting whichever character, regardless of rarity. <br />
                    There are 10 ultra rare GIFs, and 1 will be placed randomly in the collection for a lucky winner to mint. Once all Sad Pixels are minted, the final 9 GIFs will be auctioned off.

                    As Phase 1 mints out, the production of Phase 2 is unlocked. 
                    The Sad Pixels characters will be re-imagined as anime versions and airdropped to the community. 
                    As the anime drawings take form, weâ€™ll share art updates with our members. 
                    With ongoing communication and transparency, we hope to build long-term trust with our community. 
                    Diamond hands will be rewarded.

                    Have you ever seen a generative NFT project take human form? 
                    This is where things get interesting. 
                    Beyond anime, we aim to produce a series of live-action art videos. 
                    This is perhaps the most ambitious component of the project. 
                    These one-of-one pieces will be dark, yet thought-provoking video productions. 
                    We will seed this content across social media to strategically leverage our teamâ€™s entertainment industry expertise (weâ€™ve previously created YouTube and TikTok campaigns garnering 100 million+ views). 
                    We want to stand out by doing something different. The art will be bold, subversive, and address the mental health theme of the project head-on. *Insert trigger warning here.*
                    <br />
                    We will auction off these videos as one-of-one NFTs. The auction will add artistic credibility and extra visibility for the original Sad Pixels NFT collection.

                  <p>
                    It may seem counterintuitive for this project to dive into the metaverse, when it is critiquing the very idea that technology is taking over our lives. 
                    However, that is the poetic irony of the project; technological overload is the train wreck that we canâ€™t look away from. We are drawn to it, despite our awareness that it is destroying our humanity. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The metaverse will inevitably bring darkness, in the sense that it will exacerbate mental health issues. 
                    To counter this, we want to create a metaverse art gallery, where artists are welcome to explore subversive themes. 
                    We may have become desensitized by technology, but this gallery can exist as a stimulating place to revive the sense of novelty that weâ€™ve lost. 
                    Through shared experiences with provocative art, maybe weâ€™ll feel a little less numb.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Brand new art forms will exist within the metaverse, and we want to provide the art with a home. 
                    This will be a new concept for experimental and emerging cyber art forms. 
                    Weâ€™re unafraid to use this space as the go-to venue for all that is weird, dark, differentâ€” and even controversial. 
                    <br />
                    We want to partner with digital artists and recording artists to use this space for unique projects. 
                    Our team is deeply involved in the music industry, so we would love to invite our LA friends to come perform and get involved.
                  </p>
                  <p className="font-italic">Time for a serotonin boost...</p>
                  <p>
                    We could offer you a 5% royalty on secondary sales, and act as if thatâ€™s a legit source of passive incomeâ€¦ 
                    but letâ€™s be real here, that tiny royalty split across thousands of holders wonâ€™t even pay your light bills. 
                    We do want to create extra utility, but that will take reaching the scale needed to do this properly. 
                    We hope to grow Sad Pixels into a blue-chip project with a serious legacy, and then launch a passive income token from there. 
                    This could come in the form of an air-dropped project offering yield, perhaps in the form of a $SEROTONIN token. 
                    This airdrop could add a nice little *boost* to the value of your Sad Pixels NFT.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We envision our community using the $SEROTONIN token to access unique experiences, such as exclusive events in our metaverse art gallery. 
                    As you can see, weâ€™re full of creative ideas, and weâ€™re excited for this vision to fully come to life.

                    We know you guys love to hate on anonymous projects. Weâ€™re not here to rug you, but we are trying to make an artistic statement with our anonymity. 
                    The message of this collection is centered around the idea that social media and tech are destroying our mental health. 
                    Our team truly believes in this message, so it wouldnâ€™t make sense to post our socials.

                    We want our efforts to speak for themselves through the art.
